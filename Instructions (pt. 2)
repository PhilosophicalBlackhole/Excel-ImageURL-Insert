Customize the Code FOR SPECIFIC USE CASES:

Modify the urlRange to match the range containing your image URLs (e.g., "A2:A10"). 

To Run the Macro:

Press ALT + F8 to open the “Macro” dialog box, select InsertImagesFromURLs, and click Run.


Note: 
The code inserts the image into the cell to the RIGHT of each URL.
This code works if you are online and Excel has access to the internet to fetch images from URLs. 
Ensure that the URLs in the range point directly to image files (e.g., .jpg, .png).
