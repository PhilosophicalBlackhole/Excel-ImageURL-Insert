If ALT + F11 (from the first set of instructions) doesn’t work to open the VBA editor in Excel, here are a few alternatives:

1.) Use the Developer Tab:

    If you have the Developer tab enabled in Excel, you can access the VBA editor from there.

    Go to Developer > Visual Basic. 

If you don't see the Developer tab, follow these steps to enable it:

    Go to File > Options.
    In the Excel Options dialog, select Customize Ribbon.
    Check the Developer box in the right column and click OK.

Once the Developer tab is enabled, click Visual Basic on the Developer toolbar to open the VBA editor.



2.) Use the Ribbon (If Developer Tab is Disabled):

    You can also press ALT + F8 to open the Macro dialog, which lets you create a new macro. From there, you can select Edit to open the VBA editor.
    Once in the VBA editor, you can insert a new module by going to Insert > Module.


3.) Check Keyboard Shortcuts Settings:

Sometimes, keyboard shortcuts are disabled or reassigned, especially in virtualized environments or on custom keyboards. If you’re using a different keyboard or have software that might remap keys, you may need to check those settings.
